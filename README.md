## ⚠️ Announcement

Dear users of the OpenIM repository, we are pleased to announce that we are currently undergoing a major overhaul to improve our service quality and user experience. We will be using the [ws_test](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-SDK-Core/tree/ws_test) branch to make extensive updates and improvements to the main branch, ensuring that our code repository is in optimal condition.

During this time, we will need to pause PR and issue handling on the main branch. We understand that this may cause some inconvenience for you, but we believe it will provide us with better service and a more reliable code repository. If you need to submit code during this period, please submit it to the [ws_test](https://github.com/OpenIMSDK/Open-IM-SDK-Core/tree/ws_test) branch, and we will process your request as soon as possible.

We appreciate your support and trust, as well as your patience and understanding throughout this process. We value your contributions and suggestions, which are the driving force behind our continuous improvement and growth.

We anticipate that this work will be completed soon, and we will do our utmost to minimize any impact on you. Once again, we express our heartfelt thanks and apologies to you.

Thank you!
